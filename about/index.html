<p>At Virtue Therapeutics, we are at the forefront of revolutionizing the field of computational drug discovery, with a specialized focus on the challenging yet promising G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). As the largest human protein family, GPCRs play a pivotal role in numerous diseases, including diabetes, obesity, depression, and sexual dysfunction. About 1/3rd of all approved drugs target GPCRs, highlighting their significance in therapeutics developments. Our unique approach combines advanced biophysical simulations with cutting-edge Generative AI drug design. This synergy allows us to develop drugs that interact precisely with target proteins, a capability derived from our in-house computational platform tailored for GPCR drug design. Our models are continually refined with experimental data, propelling us towards becoming GPCR drug discovery leaders.</p>
<p>Our first endeavour tackles the growing epidemic of obesity by targeting a novel GPCR, the Amylin Receptor (AMYR). Amylin, a hormone linked to satiety, activates AMYR, and our goal is to create a long-acting amylin analogue with an enhanced half-life, positioning it as a potent anti-obesity drug. This stands in stark contrast to current market offerings like Ozempic and Mounjaro, which, while effective, have notable side effects such as depression, muscle loss, pancreatitis, and thyroid cancer. AMYR activation not only mitigates obesity but also treats depression. With the obesity treatment market at $100 billion, there is substantial room for innovative &ldquo;me too&rdquo; drugs. Virtue Therapeutics is poised to capture a significant share of this market, offering groundbreaking solutions to improve global health outcomes. Join us on our journey to redefine the landscape of GPCR drug discovery and to create a healthier future.</p>
